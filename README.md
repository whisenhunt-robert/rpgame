# Overview

My goal for this project was to make an RPG Stimulator, which features the sprite you control, a village like background,
and at least one None-Playable Character to interact with that says something when you walk-up to it.

I've learned how to create the game screen and set the background color; but I know I can add more to it.
However, due to unfortunately situations with life such as moving into a new apartment, I wasn't able to finish what I started.
I was able to make the game screen show up with a white background, but I unfortunately didn't have time to add more.
I did, however, create a player class, to see if I could get it to work where it registers my character as myself, Robert, with the age of 36.

The reason I wanted to make this RPG Stimulator, is because growing up people would always say that I could look into computer programming because then I could create my very own video games. I thought it'd be fun to make a one screen little village as a stimulator demo of what I could do as an RPG Maker if I were to persue into making a full RPG game.
